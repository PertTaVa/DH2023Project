#Prose Rhythm in prose
#Stylometric indicators for style analysis. 

> An important indicator of the specificity of author's style is the rhythm.

- Is it possible to determine the rhythm in a paragraph/chunk/short part of the text, when using automatic search algorithms for rhythmic measuring?

#If this is possible, then next:
> Analysis of the author's style to see how it changed over a given period of time.
> This will also allow to recognize anonymous sources based on the data entered, establish additional historical details, will allow to create a more detailed reconstruction of a particular historical period.

#Finding interesting keywords in the headers 

#Preprocess the clone of the data before classification for removing big OCR errors.

#Following dataframe after the classification

#Theme:
To be specified genre evolution, change and overlap within ECCO books

#Future ideas:
> What makes it so that a book has only one genre filtering very short chapters might be a good idea.
> If we focus on the genres then just use the best classifier.
> Interesting connections between genres in this time period.
> 
- some writes text could be more suited for genres inside genres analysis (butler)
- did jacobians use literary texts during the uprising (politics inside literary text)
- A nalysis on the change of genre of authors during their lives ( before and after key events)
- Progressivism (literature and scientific improvement)
  
#Ideas for classifier:
	-inbalanced data migth cause problems (over and undersampling)
	-data augmentation
	-genre spesific classifier accuracy scores
